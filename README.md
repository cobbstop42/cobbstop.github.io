## Motivation for this project
This project was a student assignment meant to inroducce the learner to Bootstrap.  Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.  Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework in the web developement industry. Bootstrap has components of CSS, HTML and Javascript in one package.  It has a predefined 12 coloumn responsive grid system that further enhances its usability.  Using Bootstrap allows the designer to create a fully repsonsive, unique website, in significantly less time.     

## Profile page attributes
The profile page incudes a navigation bar, footer, image and informational paragraphs.  Creating this page introduced several aspects of Bootstrap.  The components used for this page include buttons, navigation bar, typography, and thumbnails.  Combining an image with text allowed the learner to wrap the text with the image so that it is all responsive.

## Contact page attributes
The contact page introduced the learner to the forms content in Bootstrap.  Bootstrapâ€™s form controls expand on the Rebooted form styles with classes. The learner was allowed to create a customized contact form by using these predefied classes.  Components used in completing this page iclude forms, navigation bar, buttons and footer.  

## Portfolio page attributes
The Portfolio page was designed to allow the learner the opportunity to work with images in the Bootstrap program.  The page was intended to include example of completed projects and experiences in the web development industry. However, since the developer is a student and has no prior experience, these images were replaced with personal interests.  Bootstrap components used in completion of this page include Navigation bar, footer, and buttons.
