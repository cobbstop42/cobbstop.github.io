                <p> I suspect that I am an anomoly in this bootcamp class.
                    Outside of a
                    stint on an Atari 2600 and and even shorter stint on a 7200, cause it was bad, I have never
                    played many video games. I chose the athletic route which lead me to the University of North
                    Carolina and a VB scholarship.
                    After moving back home to Kansas I matriculated at KU med school where I attained a masters in
                    physical therapy. That is the field that has sustained me since 1996. I am now ready for
                    a new, out of my comfort zone career, front end website developement. I have been married since
                    1991 and have two, fairly grown, children -- Riley and Lexi.

                <p> My strengths include my competiveness and strong desire to never be defeated. I often
                    say that I hate to lose more than I love to win. I also love to laugh! I will take
                    almost any opportunity to laugh and to make others laugh! I laugh at myself daily!!!
                    Laughter is the fuel to my day! I am also very open, honest and extremely loyal. I have
                    a strong personaility that serves me well when tasks need to get accomplished!

                    My interests outside work include KU basketball, designing and painting fun projects,
                    cats (I have 3), watching movies that dont scare me,
                    and listening to music. You won't see me cooking or baking much, reading a book, or
                    traveling to far off places. If you listen closely though you'll probably hear a few
                    cuss words now and then! My lifes logo is "laugh at yourself first - before anyone else
                    can!"
